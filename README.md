<h1>TEMPERATURE CONVERTER WEBSITE</h1>

<per>
The user will input a temperature in either Fahrenheit or Celsius and press a "convert" button. The converted temperature will then be displayed with the correct unit.

 UI  included four main elements:

Input field for the user to type in their temperature -   the input is a number!
Dropdown menu or radio button for the user to choose if they are inputting in Celsius or Fahrenheit
"Convert" button to trigger the temperature conversion
Display area for the final converted temperature and unit
For an extra challenge: I have added in a third conversion option to convert from and to Kelvin as well.
